# The Git Textmate Bundle.

## I am no longer supporting this Bundle

This bundle has not been tested with TextMate 2. It may very well work,
but I will not be fixing any issues that may exist.

---

Release 1.8.0 [2009-07-31]

[James Conroy-Finn](http://github.com/jcf) is the new maintainer of this bundle. If you have cloned the bundle from Tim Harper's repository, please update your git config settings to point to his repository:

``` shell
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Git.tmbundle
git config remote.origin.url git://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle.git
```

Thanks -- the management

## Installation

``` shell
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
git clone git://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle.git Git.tmbundle
```

- In the TextMate preferences, advanced tab, shell variables, set the TM_GIT variable to point to your installation of git (ie `/usr/local/bin/git`)
- Many shortcuts are available from the Git-shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-G). Subversion commands are Command-Option-g. Less frequent commands are accessed via the menu.
- Update your bundle by running the "Update Git Bundle" command.

## Support

- [Repository](http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle)

The [Mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/git-tmbundle) has now been closed. Please feel free to report issues using the [Issue tracker](http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle/issues).

## Theme notes:

The "Git Commit Message" Language defines two scopes that can be used by a theme to generate "line too long" warnings for the first line of the commit:

- invalid.warning.line-too-long.git-commit
- invalid.error.line-too-long.git-commit

The warning scope triggers when the first line exceeds 50 characters; the error scope over 65 characters. These aren't generally-used TextMate scopes, so you can add new rules to your preferred themes, such as orange background/red background. You can also edit the regex to change the preferred character counts.
